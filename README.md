# Personal Portfolio

This is my second attempt at creating a portfolio to showcase some of my works.

It's done thanks to this tutorial:

Took me two hours and a half to set up the project / environment, and create the nav bar.
Took me 1h45 to create the hero text and the parallax background in the hero section
